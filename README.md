# CP3490---Software-Engineering-Term-Project
This is my term project for CP3490 Software Engineering for CNA. This project was created using Android Studio to code in working  apps.

The details as to what was required of me for this project are as follows:

The College of the South Pacific has offered you a free life-time gallon of wine on Tuesdays and Thursdays if you design and implement an Android App that is supposed to provide the following information/services :

Programs - Table view of offered programs with detailed view of all courses in selected programs and detailed view of selected course. Programs can be hardcoded, but courses (course id, course name, lectures, labs and credits) come from URL request (XML).

Calendar - Primary purpose of the Calendar (Collection View) is to provide users with the calendar of events (registration, holidays, exams, deadlines etc. provided as an XML file). Calendar should also have the ability to store personal events using SQLite.

Metrobus - Using Webview, simply embed Metrobus’ website.

Schedule - Allows users to see current timetables of classes based on selected program and year. Schedules come from URL requests (XML).

News - Latest news are posted in tabular form with detailed description. News come from URL requests (XML).

Contacts - Provide phone contact (call from within app), email contact (send email from within app), location (Map Kit) and Web View of college’s website.
